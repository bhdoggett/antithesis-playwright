This Project is designed to help me get a job at Antithesis. It demonstrates my familiarity with the end-to-end testing library, Playwright, by testing their [Careers](https://antithesis.com/company/careers/) page and the page for their current (at the time of this project's creation) [UI Engineer | Frontend Developer](https://antithesis.com/company/careers/?ashby_jid=0f965d12-fa14-487d-a71a-d470247d61fc) role.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- Playwright `@playwright/test` version 11.4.2
